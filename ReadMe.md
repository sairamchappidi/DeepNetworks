## Hand written digits recognition using Deep nets

Designed and developed a deep network architecture for recognizing Hand written digits of USPS data set. Used keras to compile the deep model with the categorical cross-entropy loss function and the Adam optimizer.

Analyzed the effects of different Filter Size, Kernel Size, Stride, Dense Layer Size on the model with respect to the total number of network parameters and selected the optimized parameters by evaluate them on the test set.


### Decleration
This was done as a part of assignment in UTD for ML course.
